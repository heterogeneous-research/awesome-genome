# Awesome-genome
A list of awesome things related to personal genomics.

This is put together by Patrick from [heterogeneous.co.uk](https://heterogeneous.co.uk). Pull requests welcome!!

## Contents
### Interpreting personal genome data (free)
[SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com/) - a wiki investigating human genetics. We share information about the effects of variations in DNA, citing peer-reviewed scientific publications.

[Personal Genome Project](https://pgp.med.harvard.edu/) - also known as PGP. Make your data publically available to support science research!

[DNA.land](https://dna.land/) - donate your 23andMe/Ancestry.com data to research, you get a free ancestry/traits prediction.

[Open-ancestry](https://github.com/heterogeneous-research/open-ancestry) - tutorial in python on how to do ancestry prediction on 23andMe data. Long term goal of the project to produce a fully open source ancestry prediction platform.

### Interpreting personal genome data (paid)
[GenePlaza](https://www.geneplaza.com/) - offering low-cost reports and (very importantly, in my humble opinion) users own all of their data.

[Promethease](https://promethease.com/) - health reports based on information aggregated in SNPedia for data from 23andMe, Ancestry.com, FamilyTreeDNA, Genos, etc.)


### Genomics blogs
[GenomeMag](http://genomemag.com/blog/)

[Frontline](http://www.frontlinegenomics.com/)

[GenomeWeb](https://www.genomeweb.com/) - (a little more technical news) about advancements in genomics research and technology.
